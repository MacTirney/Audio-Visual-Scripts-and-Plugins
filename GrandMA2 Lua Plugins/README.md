    * **Step 4:** Copy the plugin (plugin you want to use) .lua and (plugin you want to use) .xml files and paste them into the plugin sub-folder located on your flash drive.
        * The .lua file is the script itself, this is what the GrandMA2 system is using to run the plugin.
        * The .xml file is something that the GrandMA2 system uses to import the plugin information, the .xml file tells the system which lua file to look at, what it's labeled, and so on.
        * This plugin will now be available in any GrandMA2 system you plug your flash drive into.
    * **Step 5:** Navigate to the plugin pool in the GrandMA2 show file.

    * **Step 9:** Select the plugin file that you copied over into the plugin sub-folder and click 'Import'.
        * The GrandMA2 system will automatically label the plugin to whatever the file name for this plugin is.
    * **Step 10:** Save the plugin and then click the plugin tile to run the plugin code.
